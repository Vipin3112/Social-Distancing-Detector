# Social-Distancing-Detector
Social Distancing Detector using yolov3 convolutional neural network

1. Detect the humans in the frame with yolov3 convolutional neural network.
2. Calculate the distance between all the instances of humans detected in the frame.
3. Classify the determined distances as 'Alert' or 'Ok' for social distancing.
